# FSFC_CPU_Scheduling
FCFS CPU Scheduling Algorithm: This repository implements the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU Scheduling algorithm, which allocates CPU to processes based on arrival order, executing each sequentially without preemption. Simple yet prone to the "convoy effect," where shorter tasks wait behind longer ones.
